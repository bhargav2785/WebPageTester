Clone the WebPageTest repository\r\n~~~\r\n> git clone https://github.com/bhargav2785/WebPageTester.git\r\n~~~\r\n## Configuration\r\nJust set the MongoDB details in the file **src/config.ini**\r\n## Installation\r\n~~~\r\n> cd path_to_WebPageTester\r\n> composer install\r\n> php src/Scripts/install.php\r\n~~~\r\n## Usage\r\n~~~\r\nphp src/Scripts/test.php [options]\r\n~~~\r\n## Options\r\n~~~\r\nphp src/Scripts/test.php --help\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n-\t**-h, --help** to get the help about this tool.\r\n-\t**-u** url mode. Pass the url to test.\r\n- \t**-f** file mode. Pass the file path to test. File can contain multiple urls to test, one on ech line.\r\n-\t**-m** master file mode. Pass the master file path to test. Master file can have multiple file names in it. One on each line. Each of those path/url can have a list of test urls.\r\n-\t**--save** to save an initial test result into the database.\r\n-\t**--check** to check/validate the response coming from WPT suite.\r\n-\t**--download** to download all the results/documents for all the test in current run.\r\n-\t**-s** path to a spec file. To be used with -u option only when --save param is provided.\r\n-\t**--options** to provide custom options for a test(e.g --options=fvonly=1,private=1).\r\n\r\n## Modes\r\n**URL Mode:** Use -u to invoke URL mode. In this mode you can execute any single url directly from the command line. If you want to validate the response you can pass the --check option. In this mode if you pass --check mode then you have to pass in the -s option as well because the validator needs to know where is the spec file located.\r\n\r\n**<em>Examples:</em>**\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n> php src/Scripts/test.php -u http://google.com\r\n> php src/Scripts/test.php -u http://google.com --save\r\n> php src/Scripts/test.php -u http://google.com --save --download\r\n> php src/Scripts/test.php -u http://google.com --save --download --check -s path/to/spec/file\r\n> php src/Scripts/test.php -u http://google.com --save --download --check -s path/to/spec/file --options=private=1,runs=5\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n**File Mode:** Use -f to invoke file mode. In this mode you can execute a file from the command line. The file can contain a list of URLs to be tested follwed by option list followed by path to a spec file. So each row is made of three parts 1) test url 2) test options and 3) spec file for the test results. All three parts are separated by a single space character. You can use --check, --save and --download options in this mode. Internally each row of the file will be tested against the URL mode mentioned above. Example file can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bhargav2785/WebPageTester/master/examples/file_mode.txt).\r\n\r\n**<em>Examples:</em>**\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n> php src/Scripts/test.php -f /www/wpt/tests/urls.txt\r\n> php src/Scripts/test.php -f /www/wpt/tests/urls.txt --save\r\n> php src/Scripts/test.php -f /www/wpt/tests/urls.txt --save --check\r\n> php src/Scripts/test.php -f /www/wpt/tests/urls.txt --save --check --download\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n**Master File Mode:** Use -m to invoke master file mode. In this mode you can execute a master file from the command line. The master file can contain a list of other files/paths. Each row can be a path to the file or a remote URL which contains a list of URLs to be tested. This is basically a convenient method to run multiple files with tests in one shot. You can use --check, --save and --download options in this mode. Internally each row of the master file will be tested against the File mode mentioned above. Example file can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bhargav2785/WebPageTester/master/examples/master_mode.txt).\r\n\r\n**<em>Examples:</em>**\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n> php src/Scripts/test.php -m src/examples/local_master_file.txt\r\n> php src/Scripts/test.php -m src/examples/local_master_file.txt --save\r\n> php src/Scripts/test.php -m src/examples/local_master_file.txt --save --check\r\n> php src/Scripts/test.php -m src/examples/local_master_file.txt --save --check --download\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n## Bugs/Suggestions\r\n## License\r\nWTF license\r\n## Change log\r\n**1.0** 2014/12/20 initial version ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
